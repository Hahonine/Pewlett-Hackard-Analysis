# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Purpose

- The purpose of this analysis was to collect information on employees who are retiring, and to see potential eligibility of employees nearing retirement to enter into a mentorship program.

## Results

#### Analysis of Retirements

- We have complied a list of retiring employees. This is used primaprily for internal records.

- We have complied a count list of the titles of those employees who are retiring. This is used as a form of aggregate data to see where knowledge is being gained or lost in the company as a whole. 

#### Analysis of Mentorship Potential

- We have complied a list of employees who may potentially become mentors. This si the first step in establishing a mentorship program to retain knowledge company wide.

- The employee list includes the title of each employee, so we can focus our future mentorship program into departsments and titles that may need it most.

## Summary

#### Who is eligible to be mentored?

- Next steps would be to develope a list of potential employees who can participate as mentees in the mentorship program. This would require the filtering of data based on hire date, rather than birth date.

- We should additionally determine which departments ahve the greatest numbers of new employees, sorted by title, to determine if we need to focus hiring efforts in any particular area of expertise or department.

#### Are employees retiring faster than being hired?

- We need to query a count of new hires versus a count of newly retired employees to determine if we are losing work capacity or gaining it.

- Of use would be a query that does the above analysis, but on a per-department basis.
